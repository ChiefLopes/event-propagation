<h2 class="def">What is Event Propagation?</h2>
<p>This has to do with how events travel through the DOM until it gets to its desired node target.</p>
<p>It is like the way an electric curent travels through a wire until it gets to its destination.</p>
<p>Since the DOM is full of nodes, an evnt has to travel or pas through these nodes until it gets to the point of target or its intended node destination.</p>
    
<h2 class="title">There are 3 types of Event Propagation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Capturing Phase</li>
    <li>Target Phase</li>
    <li>Event Bubling Phase</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanations:</p>
<li>The Capturing Phase &rArr; This is the phase where the event pases from the parent nodem and travels down to the child element where it is targetted    </li>
