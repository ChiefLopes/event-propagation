    <h2 class="def">What is Event Propagation?</h2>
    <p>
      This has to do with how events travel through the DOM until it gets to its
      desired node target.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is like the way an electric curent travels through a wire until it gets
      to its destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the DOM is full of nodes, an evnt has to travel or pas through these
      nodes until it gets to the point of target or its intended node
      destination.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title">There are 3 types of Event Propagation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Event Capturing Phase</li>
      <li>Target Phase</li>
      <li>Event Bubling Phase</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Explanations:</p>
    <li>
      The Capturing Phase &rAarr; This is the phase where the event passes from
      the parent node and travels down to the child element where it is sent to.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Target Phase &rAarr; This is the phase or point where the event
      reaches the targetted element.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Bubbling Phase &rAarr; This is the opposite of the capturing phase; an
      event travels from the child back to the parent node or element.
    </li>
